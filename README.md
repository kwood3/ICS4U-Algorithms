## Pyraminx Duo - Questions:

### What Did You Learn

##### I figured out a method to solve and built an intuitive (how each move affects each side) sense for the cube. 

### What Did You Enjoy?

##### I enjoyed the (somewhat) formaility of the project

### What Could Be Better?

#### To improve the overall project, I think it would be better if the player could hold the cube during inspection time. During my inspection, I could not see the bottom face. This is not a big problem with the pyaminx duo, however, if I'm solving a cube that requires more steps, inspecting that bottom face would be cruicial. The solution to this is having someone time the player's inspection time, and than those two people could take turns solving the cube.
